The dustAPI contains the core interface and utilities

This is the conceptual root of dust framework, and as such, implementation and
language independent. In other words: the dustAPI is the member of the Language
Module, each Language Module contains a collection of source codes in that language
that provides the dustAPI functionality to the other Modules. 

This current project is the Java 6 implementation of the dustAPI. These sources 
are used all along the dust-based Module implementations.
