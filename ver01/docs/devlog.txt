I have realized that I will generate codes (both Java and C/C#), at least on constant level
to avoid String based field/channel identification. If I do that, why should I show that I
don't "like" Java? The generated code, and the actual frontend logic code should (and can)
be "normal" Java program, the difference should only be the access of the related data.

This means that string name based access ("reader"), etc is something that I don't want to see
in the end code. This is what I try to do now.
