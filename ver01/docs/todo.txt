make the "stream" as data component, cover with console and file. 
On input it should emit Char messages, support mark operations
Output should accept Text messages and indentation commands


I should integrate "process" into kernel, connect the Stream to the 
test KernelDumper, and then remove the DustStream object from the API,
have a correct dump using message communication.

Then I might start the Eval and Template units.
