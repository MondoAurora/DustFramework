EXCEPTIONS 
I don't really want to handle any. Exceptions should be thrown as, or wrapped into MAFRuntimeExceptions,
and handled by anyone in the above level. This is still better than add 'throws Exception' to any operations.


JSON
json_bnf = """
object 
    { members } 
    {} 
members 
    string : value 
    members , string : value

elements 
    value 
    elements , value

    string
    number

    array

object : sequence( const("{"), ref("members"), const("}") )
members: repeat( ref("assignment"), ",")
assignment: sequence ( const("\""), eval(name), const("\""), const(":"), ref("value") )
array: sequence( const("["), ref("elements"), const("]") )
elements: repeat( ref("value"), ",")
value: switch( ref("object"), ref("array"), eval(value))


TYPE STRUCTURE
vendor, domain, unit levels should also exist for the type management

ENTITY/ASPECT
Returned to Entity/Aspect solution, found no better yet
