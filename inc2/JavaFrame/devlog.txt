JSON RELAY
TemplateEvaluator - get callback when a template starts and ends
keep the rule name in template base, delegate names with identifier paths downwards
hopefully only template nodes will be required, no evals inside
the JSONRelay accepts the callbacks and builds the structure


EXCEPTIONS 
I don't really want to handle any. Exceptions should be thrown as, or wrapped into MAFRuntimeExceptions,
and handled by anyone in the above level. This is still better than add 'throws Exception' to any operations.


JSON
json_bnf = """
object 
    { members } 
    {} 
members 
    string : value 
    members , string : value

    [ elements ]
    [] 
elements 
    value 
    elements , value 
value 
    string
    number
    object
    array

    false
    null
"""

object : sequence( const("{"), ref("members"), const("}") )
members: repeat( ref("assignment"), ",")
assignment: sequence ( const("\""), eval(name), const("\""), const(":"), ref("value") )
array: sequence( const("["), ref("elements"), const("]") )
elements: repeat( ref("value"), ",")
value: switch( ref("object"), ref("array"), eval(value))


IDENTIFIER
MAFKernelIdentifier: I can either use a Comparable id with TreeMaps OR a POJO wit instance management
The POJO seems to be better because then there is only one lookup at the creation, and existence
verification - later I have simple lookups in the HashMaps, on object unique instance ID I suppose 


TYPE STRUCTURE
vendor, domain, unit levels should also exist for the type management

ENTITY/ASPECT
Returned to Entity/Aspect solution, found no better yet
