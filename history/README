My friend and ex-boss at iCode Ltd., George Andor gave me permission to share the source codes of some of our experimental projects. 

As a small 3rd party supporter company for Sun Microsystems and Hungarian Telekom, we had to react fast to project ideas. Some succeeded, most have failed, but as we had to work forward to get something to demo, Dust ideas were used and refined in each such project.

WARNING
These are historical experiments with very complicated internal structure - this is why I abandoned them a long time ago. 
Serious reusing or continuing them is not recommended. 
I put them here to share the value I think they do have, and let you play with them.
